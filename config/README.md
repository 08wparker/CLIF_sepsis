## Configuration

1. Rename  `config_template.json` to `config.json`.
3. Update the `config.json` with site-specific settings. You can add or remove attributes based on project requirements.

Note: the `.gitignore` file in this directory ensures that the information in the config file is not pushed to github remote repository.
